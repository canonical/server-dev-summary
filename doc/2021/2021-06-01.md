# Hello cloud-init

The purpose of this communication is to provide a status update and
highlights for any interesting subjects from cloud-init upstream. If
you would like to reach the server team, you can find us at
the #cloud-init channel on Freenode. Alternatively, you can sign up
and use the cloud-init [mailing list](mailto:cloud-init@lists.launchpad.net)
[cloud-init discourse hub](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/server/cloud-init) for more
discussion.

## Spotlight:


 * Relocation of primary upstream IRC communication from Freenode to Libera.chat#cloud-init due to political dynamics related to Freenode staff resignation. Please bring all ongoing IRC discussions to Libera.chat #cloud-init. We will keep a few clients open on Freenode #cloud-init for a while to help transition folks.
 * We plan on retiring antiquated and exlusive branch naming practices by renamining our primary upstream development branch from master to main. An email will me sent to the cloud-init mailing list to describe this change and solicit concerns or feedback.
 * Cloud-init Stable Release Update 21.2 discovered a bug in testing. We are working to resolve that bug and the release will be published to Bionic, Focal, Groovy and Hirsute.
